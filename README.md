## What is this?

A clean module-based repo that pulls in my fork of Tuxedo Keyboards' repo with my own modifications for the Eluktronics Prometheus XVI.

## Why?

I used their repo originally and I'm keeping to the spirit and letter of OpenSource yet still doing "my own thing", in a way. A cleaner split for makefile stuff, if you will.

# ABOUT

More to follow. This is early days splitting.
